To run the program use the following command:

python Smear_Detection.py <directory_path>/

Example:
python Smear_Detection.py ./sample_drive/cam_0/

One can also run for all camera angles using the batch script.

Commands in the batch script:

python Smear_Detection.py ./sample_drive/cam_0/
python Smear_Detection.py ./sample_drive/cam_1/
python Smear_Detection.py ./sample_drive/cam_2/
python Smear_Detection.py ./sample_drive/cam_3/
python Smear_Detection.py ./sample_drive/cam_5/


Note:
Make sure the path is modified in the batch script.
